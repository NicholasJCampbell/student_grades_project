# Student Grades Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes student data and create a machine learning model to predict third term student performance. 
The primary goal is to predict G3 grades without using grades from the first two semesters (G1 and G2).
I use Sci-kit Learn to make Linear Regression, SVM Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression, and stacking ensemble method.

### Conclusions/Summary


## Data Source

- [Student Performance Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) downloaded from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository 5/12/2025

---
## Project Outline
- **Data Exploration:** Jupyter notebooks in VS Code.
- **Analysis:** Python with the Pandas, Numpy, and Sci-kit Learn packages for data cleaning.
- **Visualizations :** Initial visualizations using Matplotlib in Jupyter notebooks.

###  Virtual Environment Instructions

1. After you have cloned the repo to your machine, navigate to the project 
folder in GitBash/Terminal.
1. Create a virtual environment in the project folder. 
1. Activate the virtual environment.
1. Install the required packages. 
1. When you are done working on your repo, deactivate the virtual environment.

Virtual Environment Commands
